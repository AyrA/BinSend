API Settings
============

Use this window to set the connection parameters for bitmessage.
You can do this manually or automatic.

General API Information
=======================
The bitmessage API is insecure and your password is stored unencrypted by bitmessage.
Be aware that all your data is transmitted unencrypted between this application and the bitmessage client,
including all messages and your username/password combination.

If the client runs on a remote computer you need to protect your traffic with a VPN or encrypted proxy server.

If the client runs on your own computer,
connect only to 127.0.0.1 and don't loop back via a physical network interface.

Automatic Configuration
=======================
This is recommended if you are inexperienced with INI files or if bitmessage has not yet been set up for the API.

You have to select the keys.dat file you want to read the settings from and make changes to.
The dialog will check if there is a file in the Bitmessage Application Data folder or the current directory
and offer this first but you are free to browse to another file.
This is especially necessary if you have multiple copies of bitmessage.

The automatic configuration will take all API settings from keys.dat and fills in missing or wrong settings.

Limitations
-----------
This method has various limitations you need to be aware of:

One time operation:
This method is a one time operation. It will not constantly keep your API settings in sync.
If you change the API settings in keys.dat you need to run it again.

Saving Changes:
To save changes into keys.dat you need to exit bitmessage or your changes might be lost.

keys.dat Location:
This application will not check if the keys.dat you select is stored on your local computer or on a network drive.
If you select the file from another computer the API will store an unusable IP address if none is there already.

IP Address:
If keys.dat already has an IP address set we try to figure out if that address suggests to connect locally or not.
Please edit the IP field if necessary after the assistant has completed.

Password:
The password is stored unencrypted in keys.dat. Don't use something sensitive for the password.
If no password is set, you will be offered a randomly generated default

Manual Configuration
====================
This is recommended if you know your API values.
This is commonly the case if you used other applications with the bitmessage API in the past.
Just fill in the values and test them before confirming.
Below is a description of the fields.

IP or Hostname
--------------
Write the IP or hostname in this box.
If bitmessage runs on your own computer this is likely 127.0.0.1.

If it runs on a remote computer, type the IP of that machine.
Ensure you have configured the firewall of the remote computer to allow access from your machine.

This box accepts domain names too but we recommend to use IP addresses

Port
----
This is the port on which the bitmessage client listens.
There is no official default for this, but the API documentation uses 8442 in the example

Username
--------
This is the username for the API
The API documentation example value is "username"

Password
--------
This is the password for the API
The API documentation example value is "password"

Please be aware that the password is stored unencrypted in the configuration

Test
----
Use this button to test the API settings before saving them.
If the values are correct, bitmessage will report the version number,
otherwise you will get an error message.
