Main Window
===========

Here you assemble your messages and access other functions

From
====
Use this field to select the "From" address for your messages.
This always contains two special values:

- BM-SRND: This generates a new address and sends all parts from it
- BM-MRND: This generates a new random address for each part

You can generate addresses yourself using the button next to the select box

To
==
This is the recipient.
You can type/paste an address or select one from the drop down list.
The list contains all address book entries and your own addresses.
You can manage the address book with the button next to the field.

If you don't enter anything BinSend will send out broadcasts.

Subject
=======
This is the subject of all your parts.
This can be freely chosen.
If it is blank it will be filled with the file name

Body
====
This is used to set the contents of each message.
The body can contain placeholders.
You can read more about them in the template help

Chunk size
==========
This defines the chunk size  if the file doesn't fits one part.
Please be aware that this defines the number of kilobytes from the input file and does't accounts for encoding overhead.

TTL
===
Defines how long the message is stored in the bitmessage network.
Setting this higher makes the time needed to send a part longer.

Template
========
The template button allows you to select and manage templates

File
====
Used to set the file to send.
If you want to send multiple files, please put them into an archive first.
You can either enter or paste the path manually or use the button next to the field to select a file.

Send
====
This will create parts and send your message.
